<h1 align="center">Fuzzy Possibilistic C-Means Clustering (FPCM)</h1>
This is the Jupyter Notebook and the Dataset for the mentioned Classification Predictive Modeling

## Description

This project is a fish data classification project using Fuzzy Possibilistic C-Means Clustering or FPCM algorithm that combines Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) and Possibilistic C-Means (PCM) methods.

### About the dataset:

The dataset we use is a dataset titled Fish, which presents data on 7 types of fish with a description of the length, height, width, and weight of the fish. We took the dataset from Kaggle in csv format.

## Requirements

- [Python](https://www.python.org/?downloads)
